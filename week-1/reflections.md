# Think About Time Reflection
1. Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?
  * The Pomodoro Method is something that is new to me. There are a couple things I like about this method. First it helps you stay on track by frequently checking oneself. For example if you get sidetracked for some reason, the timer will remind you that you need to regroup frequently to keep going forward. The second method that really resonated with me, is that counterintuitive productivity article. I know that I am someone who has been introduced to many of the topics that we will be talking about during this course, so I think it is important that, I approach this learning opportunity, which the hopes of learning something new or from a different perspective.
2. What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?
  * Time Boxing is a valuable time management tool, when attempting to learn something independently. When attempting to solve a problem one can go down the rabbit hole, get side tracked or non productive. The idea behind “Time Boxing” is that you set a limit of time that you are willing to spend on a task. One way that this could be used in Phase 0 is, during a coding challenge, it will be very likely that there is more than one way to solve the problem. So you start to work on the solution, and you start to realize that you have run into a blocker, and have to solve the problem with a different method. It allows one to check themselves and see if they need to change direction.
3. How do you manage your time currently?
  * I am currently a big fan of “Time Boxing”. I also have noticed when, I am best productive and the times that I am not.
4. Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?
  * I think this strategy works 90 percent of the time. However, the one issue with “Time Boxing” is scoping how long one should Time Box a task. Often tasks are thought to only take a certain amount of time, but in actuality they take much longer.
5.Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?
  * I think that I will try to take pieces from all the methods, for example, try to have a growth mindset, but also acknowledge, when I have spent more time than I would have liked on a task. I feel that every person responds a little differently to each of the methods. I am also going to try to do the pomodoro method, because it seems rather structured. I seem to respond well to that.
5. What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?
  * Because, I have devoted to spend most of my time, on Phase 0. I think that I would like to try many of these methods. I feel like this is perfect time for me to experiment with many of these methods

# The Command Line Reflection
1. What is a shell? What is "bash?"
  * A Shell is a way for the person to interact with a computer. Bash is a shell, it is one way to interact with the command line
2. What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
  * I have to say that the hardest part for me is to remember to use popd and pushd instead of doing cd a whole bunch of times
3. Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
  * yes
4.  In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?
  * man, grep, ls, cat, less,ps
5. Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

  * pwd -- show the present working dir
  * ls -- list files of a dir
  * mv -- move
  * cd -- change directory
  * ../-- parent directory
  * touch -- create empty file
  * mkdir -- create empty dir
  * less -- create a pager for a stream
  * rmdir -- remove a directory
  * rm -- remove a file
  * help -- show the builtin help for bash


# Forking and Cloning Reflection
1. If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be?                 Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?
  1. Create a new Repo:

    Click new Repo in the corner on GitHub
  1. Forking a Repo:

     Goto the existing repo that you wish to fork and click fork
  2. Cloning a repo:

    On the left right hand side of the github repo copy the url for the repo that you wish to clone
  Open a terminal, and type git clone “URL”
  3. Why fork a Repo?

    One should fork a repo, so that they can make changes or a fix to a problem, and keep the history of the existing changes. Also forks are useful if you want to use someone else’s idea as a starting point. For example, if you want to add additional features to an open source project, but the project owner, thinks the that what you are doing is a bad idea. You can fork the repo so that you can continue to use the software with your additions
4. What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?

    I didn’t struggle with this very much as I have used Git before.  I think the hardest part for me was wrapping my head around GitHubs’ interface as I have worked with other git software(Bitbucket/Stash) in the past.
