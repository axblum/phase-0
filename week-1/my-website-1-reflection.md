* Paste a link to your axblum.github.io repository.
  * [Website Repo](http://https://github.com/axblum/axblum.github.io)
* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
  * Creating a new Repo is very easy. From the GitHub website, one can click in the top right corner, clicking the plus sign to create a new repo.
  * Once the repo has been created, you can click on the side of the GitHub webpage, where you will get the info you need to clone the repo. Copy and paste the URL to the git repo. and type git clone followed by the URL.
* Describe what open source means.
  * Open source means that the code, that was used to create the software or project is open for all to see.  
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
  * Open software has advantages and disadvantages. One of the great things about open software is that one can make modifications and customizations as needed. Many people have argued that closed software is better because its more secure. In actuality, I think that closed software excuse of doing it for security is a false premise. If you have ever heard of the saying, "Security through obscurity, is not security". But on the other hand. I can see how if someone worked very hard on a project would like to be compensated for their efforts and own the rights to the project.
* Assess the importance of using licenses.
  * Licenses are important so you that you can state the limitations of your code. For example, you work on a project by yourself, but you would also like others to participate on the project using the appropriate license allows for this to happen and prevent ambiguous situations.
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
  * I think the part that was most solidified was, going through the motions of using Git.
  * I think this was pretty straight forward.  
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
  * This was a really good combination of hands on doing while still doing some reading material.
