<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
	This in particular is a bit tedious, but the fundamental process of it is very fun and cool, even if copying someone else's site is boring.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
	It wasn't difficult to research or implement.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
	We did include the Horizontal Rule, which could be argued as formatting, but we did keep away from formatting otherwise.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
	It's good for grouping stuff. It's good for basic presentation of information, which was it's original purpose. The only shortcoming is formatting and fancy features, which is where CSS and programming help!!
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
	Having a second window open for reference when needed helps. You can also build a skeleton to fill in the information so you can focus on the HTML first and then the information.
